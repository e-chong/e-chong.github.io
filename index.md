**[Azavea - Summer of Maps Fellowship](https://www.summerofmaps.com/)**

As a fellow in [Azavea's](https://www.azavea.com/) Summer of Maps program, I worked on geospatial analysis projects for two non-profit organization clients:

- **The State Gun Law Project:** In this project, I identified and mapped patterns of spatial clustering over time in a novel gun crime dataset created by [The State Gun Law Project](https://stategunlawproject.org/) that spanned 34 cities and several decades.  
  + [Blog post](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2020/09/04/choosing-cell-size-for-point-pattern-analysis/)
  + [GitHub repository](https://github.com/summer-of-maps/2020-PennPraxis-StateGunLawProject)
- **OpenStreetMap US:** In this project with [OpenStreetMap US](https://www.openstreetmap.us/), I measured and visualized progress on UN Sustainable Development Goals across several American cities using data from OpenStreetMap. I compared these results to measurements made using city-published datasets and found that, while data quality varied by city, OpenStreetMap could be a viable and scalable source of geospatial data for monitoring the UN SDGs.

**[Airport Market Leakage -- Airport Choice in Megaregions](/html/Airport_Market_Leakage_Code_Library_and_Overview.html)**

A vignette summarizing the R code and visualizations I created for Professor Megan S. Ryerson and Professor Amy M. Kim's research into airport choice in megaregions like Texas-Oklahoma-Louisiana.

**EuroSAT Land Use and Land Cover Classification using Deep Learning**

In this notebook, I used deep learning methods (implemented in Python using Keras) to identify land use and land cover classifications for images in the [EuroSAT dataset](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat "EuroSAT"), a collection of 27,000 Sentinel-2 satellite images consisting of 13 spectral bands and 10 pre-labeled classes (e.g., Highway, AnnualCrop, River, Residential).

My best overall model was able to accurately classify 94.9% of the images in a 50% testing set.

**Scooter Demand Prediction**

[Yijia Liu](https://ophelialyj.github.io/ "Yijia Liu"), [Xinyi Miao](https://xinyimsumyee.github.io/ "Xinyi Miao"), and I created this model for predicting demand for dockless shared scooters in cities that do not currently have the vehicles. We also created a proof-of-concept web application for users to visualize the geography of our predictions and compare them to several demographic and socio-economic indicators.

**[Shiny App for Simulating MLB Contracts (draft)](https://e-chong.shinyapps.io/contract_opt-out_app/ "MLB Contract Opt-Out App")**

Inspired by [this piece](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/whats-an-opt-out-worth/ "What's an Opt Out Worth?") from FanGraphs' writer Ben Clemens, I implemented Ben's model in R and created a Shiny app that allows users to project the likelihood that an MLB player will exercise the opt-out clause in his contract using Monte Carlo methods.

**[Predicting Home Sale Prices in San Francisco](/html/Predicting_San_Francisco_Home_Sale_Prices.html)**

[Natasha Tabachnikoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-tabachnikoff/ "Natasha Tabachnikoff") and I collaborated to create this model for predicting home sale prices in San Francisco.

**Modeling Flood Inundation in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta**

A model for predicting flood inundation in Calgary and Edmonton that [Leo Harth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-harth/ "Leonardo Harth") and I created for the _Land Use and Environmental Modeling_ class [@PennMUSA](https://twitter.com/PennMUSA "PennMUSA"). The deliverables included a video introducing our model and comparing alternative modeling approaches as well as a short pdf summarizing our results.
